Lasem aims to be a C/Gobject based SVG/Mathml renderer and editor, supporting CSS
style sheets (only rendering is implemented for now). It uses cairo and pango as
it's rendering abstraction layer, and then support numerous output formats: xlib,
PNG, SVG, PDF, PS, EPS... It's written by Emmanuel Pacaud.

Currently, this is version `lasem@0.4.1`.
